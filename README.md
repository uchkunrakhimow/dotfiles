## Setup Instructions

To set up these dotfiles on your machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/uchkunrakhimow/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
   ```

2. **Create symlinks**:

   Change to the `.dotfiles` directory and create symlinks to the configuration files:

   ```bash
   cd ~/.dotfiles
   ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.config/alacritty ~/.config/alacritty
   ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim
   ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.config/zsh ~/.config/zsh
   ```

   Alternatively, you can run the provided script (if available) to automate this process.

3. **Zsh Configuration**:

   Ensure you have `zsh` installed and set as your default shell:

   ```
   

    To ensure that your Zsh configuration is loaded properly, add the following line to your `.zshrc` file:

    ```bash
    source $HOME/.config/zsh/source.zsh
    ```


4. **Reload Your Shell**:

   ```bash
   exec zsh
   ```
